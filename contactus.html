<h2>Let's fix what's holding your site back</h2>

<p>Whether you need an SEO-first website build, ongoing maintenance, or targeted technical and on-page fixes—especially when Google isn't properly crawling, indexing, or understanding your key pages—I can help identify what's broken and build a plan to fix it.</p>

<p>Share your site URL and goals below. I'll run a quick audit to pinpoint the highest-impact issues, then outline a clear plan with implementation steps and tracking.</p>

<h3>What to include in your message</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Website URL</strong> plus the main pages that matter most (service pages, collections, blog posts)</li>
<li><strong>What's not working</strong>—indexing problems, rankings drops, lack of leads, slow speed, broken links, redirect/canonical issues, poor titles or headings</li>
<li><strong>Target market</strong> (e.g., Singapore) and 3–5 example searches your customers might use</li>
<li><strong>Any constraints</strong>—platform, CMS, deadlines, access limitations</li>
</ul>
